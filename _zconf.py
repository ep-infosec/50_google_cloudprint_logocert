Support for mdns operations.

This module will provide a class to browse MDNS messages on the local network.
It depends on the Python package zeroconf.

The main interface to this module are the Wait_for_privet_mdns_service function
and MDNS_Browser class. Wait_for_privet_mdns_service instatiates a listening
session and closes it within the function whereas MDNS_Browser lets the caller
decide when to close the session. The _Listener class is intended for the
internals of this module and users of this module do not directly need
to use it.
