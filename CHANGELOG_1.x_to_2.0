Google Cloud Print Logo Certification Tool

Here are the major changes that occurred between version 1.X to 2.0
Please also see the README for updated set up details

-  No more WebDriver usage, all interactions are now done directly via Privet
   or GCP interfaces

-  Privet API is used instead of the Chrome Browser for local printing

-  _config.py has been overhauled, please see comments in that file and README

-  Power on's are polling waits instead of sleeps, the script polls for privet
   advertisement from the printer

-  Passwords are no longer stored in plaintext, you will have to enter the
   password the first time you log into the USER account. Then you also have
   to manually accept the user data authorization prompt.
   This process should happen only once per testing session as the Google
   account should remain logged in and OAUTH access and refresh tokens are
   stored on disk

-  Console output is now colorized using ANSI escape sequences, these will
   automatically kick in on UNIX terminals. For Windows, cmd does not support
   it (except Win10 but you have to manually enable it), so the colorized output
   is turned off by default. It is highly recommended that an ANSI supporting
   alternative such as ConEmu is used. If an ANSI supported alternative is used,
   you need to set FORCE_COLOR_OUTPUT to True in _config.py
   (See console_output.png for a preview of the new output format)

-  A sound is played to notify the user when the tool is waiting for user
   interaction.
   Note: If you are running this tool on Windows from ConEmu, note that ConEmu
   suppresses this beeping sound by default, you can enable sounds by going to
   Settings->Features and unchecking 'Suppress Bells'

-  Google sheet output is better formatted for readability. On test failures,
   a single testcase re-run command is added so you can focus on passing that
   test and without having to re-run the other tests in the suite

-  The old master branch is now branched into 'legacy_master' on GitHub
